Tiny programs, Basic logic, Real practice.
All the small steps that built my understanding of C.

### **📁 What’s inside**

* pointers
* structs
* enums

Nothing fancy — just raw fundamentals.

### **🎯 Purpose**

A personal archive of:

* what I learned

If you’re learning C, you can use this repo the same way:
**a playground, not a masterpiece.**

Actively adding new small projects as I learn.

### **🧠 Goal**

Get comfortable with C basics, then move on to real-world projects in higher-level languages — without forgetting the fundamentals.

Keep it simple.
Keep it growing.
